## Motivation

I recently gave a talk on writing reproducible manuscripts using R Markdown and the R package [*papaja*](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) (*p*reparing *apa j*ournal *a*rticles). One of my main motivations for using R to write up my manuscripts is contained in a tweet by Pamela Jacobsen:

Why does so much of academia involve cutting and pasting information from one document to another document?

### A reproducible workflow 

In the workshop, I go through methods that keep you from manually transcribing and/or copy pasting tables, figures, statistical output, and citations over and over again.   

Perhaps my favorite introduction to the idea of a [**reproducible workflow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw) (and the horrors of a non-reproducible workflow) is given in this short YouTube video:

#### Benefits

The video hints at some of the benefits of a reproducible workflow. A reproducible workflow is...  

‚ö†Ô∏è  Less error-prone  
‚è≥  Less time-consuming  
‚áÑ   More dynamic  
üîé  More transparent  

### The result

You can find a list of papers written with papaja [here](https://github.com/crsh/papaja#papers-written-with-papaja). Here's a sneak peek of what's happening behind the scenes, and the rendered result:
