abstract: Systems based on Machine Learning are complex. It is common to observe that some models do not solve the problems they should solve and end up not being used in practice. The Machine Learning Canvas aims to gather the main information for Machine Learning projects. In this mini talk, we are going to explore what this path is from collecting data to generating value. November 2019, The Developer's Conference, Porto Alegre - RS, Brazil.
