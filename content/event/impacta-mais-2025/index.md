abstract: On March 20, 2025, I had the honor of representing OncoAI in a roundtable at Impacta Mais 2025 — the largest forum for impact investing and businesses in Brazil, organized by Impact Hub São Paulo and co-ideated by ICE. Alongside leaders like Umberto De Vuono (Carbon Token) and dana meschede (Dana Agro), we discussed key topics such as impact measurement, stakeholder engagement, future trends in our sectors, and what drives us toward building a more sustainable future. The event brought together over 1,500 participants committed to generating positive social and environmental impact through innovation and new business models.
