abstract: Have you created so many datasets and so many models that you no longer know who is who? Don't remember which version of the model is in production anymore? Another Data Scientist joined the project and she/he can't reproduce the experiments? In this talk, we'll explore how Open Source Data Version Control (DVC) can help solve these problems. November 2019, The Developer's Conference, Porto Alegre - RS, Brazil.
