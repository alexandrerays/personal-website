abstract: "Breast cancer is one of the highest worldwide incidence. In Brazil, according to INCA report, the former mostly affects women,  being  responsible  for  around  28%  of  mortality among diagnosed cases and has by association risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, frequent exposure to ionizing radiation, in addition to evidence such as smoking. Moreover, in the three-year period from 2023 to 2025, the estimate  is  that  70  thousand  people  will  be  affected  by breast  cancer  and  of  these,  40%  may  experience a recurrence of the disease. Treatments for different type of tumor have distint protocols depending on the grade, stage of the disease and type of neoplasm. In the case of breast cancer,  breast  surgery  followed  by  chemotherapy  or radiotherapy  are  the  mostcommon.  Currently,  the immunotherapy associated with liquid biopsy has stood out in the evaluation of ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) which helps in the detection of circulating tumor DNA in the blood in  order  to  evaluate  possible  diagnoses  of  recurrence. Within  this  context,  many  different  treatments  when combined, can offer the patient a longer survival free from disease recurrence. Still, many patients who undergo this treatment  do  not  experience  clinical  benefit  and  end  up presenting relapse or progression of the disease. From the aforementioned analyses, it is interesting to note that the treatment is prescribed based on the clinical data of patients described  in  the  literature.  However,  there  may  be  other clinical  aspects  to  be  considered  when  detectingbetter treatment prescription in order to avoid relapses that have not been considered. In this way, the patient's clinical and demographic  data  with  the  neoplasm  in  conjunction  with those of other patients can provide valuable information for predictive analyzes  that  can  be  carried  out  by  applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Furthermore, studies can be carried out on which variables help to increase the probability  of  recurrence,  as  well  as  recommending  the treatment  protocol  personalized  based  on  predictive analysis  and  generated  models.  As  highlighted,  there  is currently a set of variables described in the literature which may indicate factors that have recurrence as a prognosis. However, greater number of variables that can corroborate the analysis  can  allow  more  assertions  are  taken  for treatment. There are still few published works that apply AI techniques to predict the probability of neoplasm recurrence and which clinical variables are predominantly responsible. Within this context, Personalized Medicine emerged as a way  to  assist  in  the  diagnostic  profile  followed  by  the analysis  of  the  patient's  probability  of  recurrence  in  an assertive and accurate way for each case. To this end, the development  of  a  solution  based  on  Artificial  Intelligence capable of tracing a patient's clinical profile and evaluating the  best  treatment  in  a  personalized  way  becomes  an increasingly pressing need. In this way, data collection have come from Doctor Arnaldo Cancer Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil through acollaborative platform. This platform have allowed structuring data from patient anamnesis, as well as collecting radiological images so that machine learning and deep  learning  models  can  be  generated,  capable  of extracting  knowledge  from  these  data  and  supporting medical decision-making. The solution must, among others, propose  personalized  forms  of  treatment,  estimate  the probability of recurrence, and reduce the length of hospital stay."
