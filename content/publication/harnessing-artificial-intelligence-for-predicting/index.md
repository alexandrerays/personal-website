abstract: "Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women, with recurrence prediction remaining a significant challenge. In this context, artificial intelligence application and its resources can serve as a powerful tool in analyzing large amounts of data and predicting cancer recurrence, potentially enabling personalized medical treatment and improving the patientâ€™s quality of life. Thus, the systematic review examines the role of AI in predicting breast cancer recurrence using clinical data, imaging data, and combined datasets. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks, especially when applied to combined data, demonstrate strong potential in improving prediction accuracy. SVMs are effective with high-dimensional clinical data, while Neural Networks in genetic and molecular analysis. Despite these advancements, limitations such as dataset diversity, sample size, and evaluation standardization persist, emphasizing the need for further research. AI integration in recurrence prediction offers promising prospects for personalized care but requires rigorous validation for safe clinical application."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We conduct a study in which participants form American Sign Language hand signs while being recorded with a Microsoft Kinect. The resulting infra-red distance data are used to train both neural networks with dropout (dropout NN) and Random Forests; dropout NN perform significantly better.
