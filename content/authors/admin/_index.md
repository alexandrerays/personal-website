I am a Data Scientist with over 10 years of experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, software engineering, and systems design. Throughout my career, I have worked across multiple industries, including investment banking, IT consulting & outsourcing, fintech, manufacturing, education, healthcare, and casinos.

I have a strong academic background, holding a bachelor's degree in computational physics and a master's degree in engineering, both from [**USP (University of São Paulo)**](https://www5.usp.br/).

My expertise spans Python, SQL, machine learning, statistics, data modeling, and project management. I have successfully led multidisciplinary teams from various countries. With over three years of experience working for US companies, I have developed a deep understanding of global business and technology landscapes. 

I thrive in complex problem-solving environments, bringing a proactive and strategic approach to optimizing analytical processes, designing scalable systems, and driving innovation. Whether in financial services, education, or healthcare, I adapt quickly to new challenges and leverage data-driven insights to create impactful solutions.
